# API Assignment

We have learned about asynchronous Javascript, and specifically about using promises and async/await to handle asynchronous Javascript. In this assignment you will practice these skills by making a website that uses an API that you can fetch data from. You have the freedom to use any free API you want (click [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file) for a comprehensive list).
